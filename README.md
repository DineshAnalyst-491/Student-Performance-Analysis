📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Performance
📘 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Student Performance dataset to understand how various factors influence academic outcomes.
The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, statistical insights, and visualizations across different attributes such as gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and subject scores.

All analysis is documented in the notebook:
👉 EDA_on_student_performance_project.ipynb

🎯 Objectives of the Project

The goal of this project is to:

Explore the dataset and understand its structure

Clean and preprocess the data

Visualize relationships between student performance and demographic factors

Analyze how different variables impact Math, Reading, and Writing scores

Identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset

Present insights that could help in improving student learning outcomes

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset typically includes the following features:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity Group

Parental Level of Education

Lunch Type

Test Preparation Course Completion

Math Score

Reading Score

Writing Score

(If your dataset has additional or fewer fields, I can adjust this.)

🧪 Steps Performed in the Notebook
✔ 1. Data Loading & Inspection

Viewed dataset shape

Checked datatypes

Identified missing values

Understood distribution of scores

✔ 2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (if any)

Standardized categories

Removed inconsistencies

✔ 3. Statistical Summary

Descriptive stats of all numerical columns

Correlation calculation

✔ 4. Data Visualization (EDA)

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, visualizations include:

Histograms

Count plots

Bar charts

Box plots

Pair plots

Correlation heatmap

Comparison plots for:

Gender vs scores

Lunch type vs performance

Test preparation vs performance

Parental education vs student outcomes

✔ 5. Insights & Conclusions

The notebook concludes with key findings, such as:

Students who completed test preparation courses performed better

Parental education has a positive influence

Reading and Writing scores have a strong correlation

Some demographic groups show differences in performance trends
